## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### 1. Clone the Repository (or download the project files)
```bash
# If you are using Git
git clone <repository_url>
cd synergysphere
```
If you downloaded the project files, navigate to the `synergysphere` directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup
a.  **Create PostgreSQL Database:**
    Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql` or pgAdmin) and create a new database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE synergysphere;
    ```
b.  **Run Schema Migrations:**
    Connect to the `synergysphere` database and execute the SQL commands from the `database.sql` file located in your project root. This will create all necessary tables:
    ```bash
    # Example using psql
    psql -U your_postgres_user -d synergysphere -f database.sql
    ```
    (Replace `your_postgres_user` with your PostgreSQL username)

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory (`synergysphere/.env`). This file will store your sensitive credentials.

```
# SMTP (Email Service) Configuration - for password reset
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_brevo_smtp_user # e.g., 9669af001@smtp-brevo.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_brevo_smtp_password # Your Brevo SMTP Key

# Database Configuration
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=synergysphere
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password # IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual PostgreSQL password
DB_PORT=5432

# JWT Secret (for user authentication)
# IMPORTANT: Change this to a strong, random string in production
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```
**Important:** Replace the placeholder values (`your_brevo_smtp_user`, `your_brevo_smtp_password`, `your_postgres_password`, `your_jwt_secret`) with your actual credentials.

## Usage

### Start the Server
From the project root directory, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts on file changes.

### Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Demo Walkthrough (Example Scenario)
You can follow a demo scenario to showcase the features:
1.  **Sign Up:** Create new user accounts (e.g., `alice@example.com`, `bob@example.com`, `charlie@example.com`).
2.  **Login:** Log in as a project manager (e.g., `alice@example.com`).
3.  **Create Projects:** Add new projects like "SynergySphere 1.0 Development".
4.  **Add Tasks:** Populate projects with tasks, assigning them to different users and setting due dates.
5.  **Update Task Status:** Use the drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns.
6.  **Communicate:** Add comments to project discussion threads.
7.  **Test Password Reset:** Use the "Forgot Password" feature to demonstrate email-based password recovery.
